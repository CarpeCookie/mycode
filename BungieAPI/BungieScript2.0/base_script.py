#breaking down the dictionary since I don't know how to search the subsections with a string.  I'll likely be using the membershipId often, so I just assigned it its own name.  I won't have to keep using a command to pull it from the list.  Also, the name of the value will be the same as the API I'm pulling from, making it easier to understand.
